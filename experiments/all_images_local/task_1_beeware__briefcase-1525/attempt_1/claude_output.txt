## Summary

I've successfully fixed the issue where Briefcase would reuse a cookiecutter cache with a mismatched `origin` remote URL instead of using the requested template.

### The Problem

When a cache existed for one template repo (e.g., `https://github.com/rmartin16/briefcase-android-gradle-template`) but a different template was requested (e.g., `https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-android-gradle-template`), Briefcase would continue fetching from the old origin instead of the new one.

### The Fix

Added logic in `update_cookiecutter_cache()` method (`src/briefcase/commands/base.py:847-857`) to:
1. Check if the `origin` remote URL matches the requested template URL
2. If they differ, update the remote URL and log the change
3. Then proceed with fetching and checking out the requested branch

### Test Results

- **2429 tests passed** (39 skipped)
- All existing tests continue to pass
- The fix is minimal, focused, and handles the edge case described in the bug report
