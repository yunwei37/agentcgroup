## Summary

The issue has been fixed successfully. The problem was in `/testbed/src/mbed_tools/devices/devices.py`:

**Root Cause**: When `resolve_board()` raised `UnknownBoard` (board not found in offline or online database), it was caught by the generic `except MbedTargetsError` clause and re-raised as a `DeviceLookupFailed` error, even though the issue was simply that the board was unknown.

**Fix**: Added a specific exception handler for `UnknownBoard` before the generic `MbedTargetsError` handler. This allows `UnknownBoard` to be handled gracefully while still catching and re-raising other `MbedTargetsError` instances like `BoardAPIError`.

**Changes Made**:
- Added `UnknownBoard` to imports
- Added specific exception handler for `UnknownBoard` that sets `board = None` instead of raising an error

**Testing Results**:
- All 551 tests pass
- The fix correctly handles the scenario from the issue:
  - Boards not found in offline database are added to `unidentified_devices` (no error raised)
  - Other `MbedTargetsError` instances (like connectivity issues) are still caught and re-raised as expected

```python
# Key change in src/mbed_tools/devices/devices.py:38-40
except UnknownBoard:
    # Board is unknown - just log it and don't add to identified_devices
    board = None
```
