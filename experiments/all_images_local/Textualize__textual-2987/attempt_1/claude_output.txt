## Summary

I have successfully fixed the issue where mouse move events were not reaching the Screen object.

### Problem
Mouse move events were never being sent to the Screen object, even though other mouse events (MouseDown, MouseUp) were being properly posted to the Screen when the mouse was over the screen itself.

### Root Cause
In `/testbed/src/textual/screen.py:809-862`, the `_handle_mouse_move` method was forwarding mouse events to widgets but never posting them to the Screen when the widget was the Screen itself. This was inconsistent with how other mouse events were handled in `_forward_event` (line 893), which posts MouseUp events to the Screen when appropriate.

### Fix
Added 2 lines of code in `/testbed/src/textual/screen.py:844-845` to post MouseMove events to the Screen when the mouse is over the Screen itself:

```python
if widget is self:
    self.post_message(mouse_event)
```

### Testing
All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ 7 mouse input tests
- ✅ 23 tabs tests  
- ✅ 68 data table tests
- ✅ 64 option list tests
- ✅ 158 total tests related to mouse, screen, and events

The fix ensures MouseMove events now properly reach the Screen object, allowing the Screen to track and handle mouse events originating from the screen itself.
