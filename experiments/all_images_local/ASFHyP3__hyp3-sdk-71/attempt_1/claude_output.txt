## Summary

Fixed the issue by adding the `__iter__` method to the `Batch` class in `/testbed/hyp3_sdk/jobs.py:135-136`.

The fix allows `Batch` objects to be iterable, enabling usage like:
```python
jobs = [job['files'][0]['size'] for job in jobs]
```

All 29 tests pass, and the fix was verified by manually testing iteration over Batch objects.
