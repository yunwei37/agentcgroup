## Summary

I've successfully fixed the issue with `INFO` response parsing in redis-py.

### The Problem
The `parse_info()` function in `redis/_parsers/helpers.py` had a bug in the `get_value()` helper function (line 41). The original condition was:
```python
if "," not in value or "=" not in value:
```

This meant that any value without a comma OR without an equals sign would be attempted to be parsed as an integer or float. This caused fields with only one `KEY=VALUE` pair (e.g., `TEXT=1`) to be returned as strings instead of dictionaries.

### The Fix
Changed line 41 from:
```python
if "," not in value or "=" not in value:
```
to:
```python
if "=" not in value:
```

Now any value containing an equals sign is always parsed as a dictionary, whether it has multiple key-value pairs or just one.

### Verification
The fix has been tested and verified to:
- ✓ Return dictionaries for single `KEY=VALUE` pairs (the bug scenario)
- ✓ Return dictionaries for multiple `KEY=VALUE` pairs
- ✓ Return integers and floats for regular fields without `KEY=VALUE` format
- ✓ Handle all edge cases correctly
